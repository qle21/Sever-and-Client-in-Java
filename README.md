# Java Client-Server Project ReadMe

This Java project demonstrates a simple client-server architecture, facilitating communication between two entities â€“ a client and a server. Below is an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions on usage.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The project showcases a basic client-server interaction, enabling communication between a client application and a server.

### Components
1. **Client:** Initiates a connection to the server, sends requests, and receives responses.
2. **Server:** Listens for incoming client connections, processes client requests, and sends back responses.

### Communication Protocol
The client and server communicate using a simple protocol, such as sending messages in a specified format (e.g., JSON, XML).

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main components: `Client` and `Server`. The source code, along with relevant configuration files, is organized as follows:

```
|-- src
|   |-- com
|       |-- yourcompany
|           |-- client
|               |-- Client.java
|           |-- server
|               |-- Server.java
|-- README.md
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd java-client-server-project
```

### 2. Compile the Code
```bash
javac src/com/yourcompany/client/Client.java
javac src/com/yourcompany/server/Server.java
```

### 3. Run the Server
```bash
java -classpath src com.yourcompany.server.Server
```

### 4. Run the Client
```bash
java -classpath src com.yourcompany.client.Client
```

### 5. Interact with the Client and Server
- The client sends requests to the server.
- The server processes the requests and sends back responses.
- View the console outputs to see the interaction between the client and server.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project by modifying the code, adding additional features, or enhancing the communication protocol based on your requirements.

## Dependencies

The project does not have external dependencies beyond the Java Standard Library.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your firewall settings allow communication on the specified port (default is 8080).
- Modify the port numbers or communication protocol as needed.
